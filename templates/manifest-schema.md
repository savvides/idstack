## Manifest Schema Reference

The idstack manifest lives at `.idstack/project.json`. Schema version: **1.4**.

This is the canonical schema. Every skill writes to its own section using the shapes documented here; **all other sections must be preserved verbatim**. There is one source of truth — this file. If the schema ever needs to change, edit `templates/manifest-schema.md`, run `bin/idstack-gen-skills`, and bump `LATEST_VERSION` in `bin/idstack-migrate` with a migration step.

### Two outputs per skill: JSON manifest + HTML report

Every skill that produces findings emits **both**:

- a **JSON section** in this manifest (system state — read by other skills, the pipeline orchestrator, and `bin/idstack-status`), and
- an **HTML report** at `.idstack/exports/<course-slug>/<skill>.html` (the human view — read by the instructional designer).

The HTML report follows the visual contract in `templates/report.html.tmpl` and the content contract in `templates/report-format.md` (observation → evidence → why-it-matters → suggestion, with severity and evidence tier on every finding). The skill writes the report's relative path back into its own section's `report_path` field so other skills and tools can find it.

`<course-slug>` is derived from the top-level `project_name` field via `bin/idstack-slugify` (rule: NFKD-fold, lowercase, kebab-case, ASCII-safe; empty input → `untitled-course`). The slug is computed deterministically — skills don't cache it in the manifest. All exports for a course — per-skill HTML reports, the pipeline dashboard at `index.html`, and LMS packages (`course-export.imscc`, `scorm-export.zip`) — live under the same `.idstack/exports/<course-slug>/` folder so the deliverable is self-describing when zipped, emailed, or handed off.

`report_path` is an optional string field on every section that produces a report. It is a path relative to the project root (typically `.idstack/exports/<course-slug>/<skill>.html`). Empty string means the skill hasn't run yet, or ran in a mode that didn't produce a report. Renaming a course's `project_name` changes the slug, which moves future exports to a new folder; older folders are left in place.

### Two ways to write to the manifest

**1. Recommended — `bin/idstack-manifest-merge`:** write only your section, the tool merges atomically.

```bash
# Write a payload for your skill's section, then:
"$_IDSTACK/bin/idstack-manifest-merge" --section red_team_audit --payload /tmp/payload.json
```

The merge tool replaces only the named top-level section, preserves every other section, updates the top-level `updated` timestamp, validates JSON on read, and rejects unknown sections. Use this in preference to inlining the full manifest in `Edit` operations.

**2. Fallback — manual full-manifest write:** if the merge tool is unavailable for some reason, Read the full manifest, modify only your section, Write back. Preserve all other sections verbatim. Use the full schema below as reference.

### Top-level fields

| `created` | (any, once) | ISO-8601 timestamp of first creation. Don't overwrite. |
| `updated` | (any) | ISO-8601 of last write. Updated automatically by `bin/idstack-manifest-merge`. |
| `context` | needs-analysis (initial) | Modality, timeline, class size, etc. Edited by skills that learn new context. |
| `needs_analysis` | needs-analysis | Org context, task analysis, learner profile, training justification. |
| `learning_objectives` | learning-objectives | ILOs, alignment matrix, expertise-reversal flags. |
| `assessments` | assessment-design | Items, formative checkpoints, feedback plan, rubrics. |
| `course_content` | course-builder | Generated modules, syllabus, content paths. |
| `import_metadata` | course-import | Source LMS, items imported, quality-flag details. |
| `export_metadata` | course-export | Export destination, items exported, readiness check. |
| `quality_review` | course-quality-review | QM standards, CoI presence, alignment audit, cross-domain checks, scores. |
| `red_team_audit` | red-team | Confidence score, dimensions, findings (with stable ids), top actions. |
| `accessibility_review` | accessibility-review | WCAG / UDL scores, violations, recommendations, quick wins. |
| `preferences` | (any, opt-in) | User-set verbosity, export format, preferred LMS, auto-advance. |

### Per-section item shapes

These document the **shape of array elements and dictionary values** that the canonical schema leaves as `[]` or `{}`. Skills should produce items in these shapes; downstream skills can rely on them.

**`learning_objectives.alignment_matrix.ilo_to_activity`** — keyed by ILO id, values are arrays of activity names:
```json
{ "ILO-1": ["Module 1 case study", "Discussion 2"], "ILO-2": [] }
```

**`learning_objectives.alignment_matrix.ilo_to_assessment`** — same shape, values are arrays of assessment titles.

**`learning_objectives.alignment_matrix.gaps[]`** — each item:
```json
{
  "ilo": "ILO-1",
  "type": "untested|orphaned|underspecified|bloom_mismatch",
  "description": "ILO-1 has no matching assessment in the active modules.",
  "severity": "critical|warning|info"
}
```

**`learning_objectives.ilos[]`** — each item:
```json
{
  "id": "ILO-1",
  "statement": "Analyze competitive forces in...",
  "blooms_level": "analyze",
  "blooms_confidence": "high|medium|low"
}
```

**`assessments.items[]`** — each item:
```json
{
  "id": "A-1",
  "type": "quiz|discussion|rubric|peer_review|gate|...",
  "title": "Module 1 Quiz",
  "weight": 5,
  "ilos_measured": ["ILO-1", "ILO-3"],
  "rubric_present": true,
  "elaborated_feedback": false,
  "alignment_status": "weak|moderate|strong"
}
```

**`assessments.rubrics[]`** — each item:
```json
{
  "id": "rubric-1",
  "title": "SM Project Rubric",
  "criteria": [{"name": "...", "blooms_level": "...", "weight": 0}],
  "applies_to": ["A-3"]
}
```

**`import_metadata.quality_flag_details[]`** — each item (replaces the legacy `_import_quality_flags` root field that sometimes appeared in the wild):
```json
{
  "key": "orphan_module_8",
  "description": "Module 8 wiki content exists in the cartridge but is not referenced in <organizations>.",
  "severity": "warning|critical|info",
  "evidence": "Optional citation tag, e.g. [Alignment-1] [T5]"
}
```

**`red_team_audit.dimensions.<name>.findings[]`** — each item (matches the `<dimension>-<n>` id convention from the red-team orchestrator):
```json
{
  "id": "alignment-1",
  "description": "ILO-2 (vision/mission) has no matching assessment.",
  "module": "Module 4",
  "severity": "critical|warning|info"
}
```

**`accessibility_review.wcag_violations[]`** — each item:
```json
{
  "id": "wcag-1",
  "criterion": "1.3.1 Info and Relationships",
  "level": "A|AA|AAA",
  "description": "All cartridge HTML pages lack <h1> elements.",
  "affected": ["page1.html", "page2.html"],
  "severity": "critical|warning|info"
}
```

**`accessibility_review.udl_recommendations[]`** — each item:
```json
{
  "id": "udl-1",
  "principle": "engagement|representation|action_expression",
  "description": "Add transcripts to all videos.",
  "status": "fully_met|partial|not_met"
}
```

**`quality_review.qm_standards.<standard>.findings[]`**, **`quality_review.alignment_audit.findings[]`**, **`quality_review.cross_domain_checks.<check>.flags[]`**, and other findings arrays — each item:
```json
{
  "id": "<dimension>-<n>",
  "description": "...",
  "evidence": "[Domain-N] [TX]",
  "severity": "critical|warning|info"
}
```

### Mode field — design-new vs audit-existing

`needs_analysis.mode`, `assessments.mode`, and `course_content.mode` record which operating mode the corresponding skill ran in. Trigger: `import_metadata.source` ∈ `{cartridge, scorm, canvas-api}` plus the relevant section being non-empty (skill-specific check).

Allowed values per skill:
- `needs_analysis.mode`: `"design-new"` or `"audit-existing"`
- `assessments.mode`: `"Mode 1"`, `"Mode 2"`, or `"Mode 3"` (Mode 1 = full upstream data, Mode 2 = ILOs-from-scratch, Mode 3 = audit existing assessments)
- `course_content.mode`: `"build-new"` or `"gap-fill"`

Empty string means the skill hasn't run yet or didn't record the mode (legacy manifests).

**`assessments.audit_notes[]`** — only populated in Mode 3. Records which audit findings the user chose to act on:
```json
{
  "target_id": "A-3",
  "action": "applied|deferred|declined",
  "description": "Rubric criterion for ILO-2 added: 'Synthesis depth (1-4 scale)'.",
  "reason": "Optional — only meaningful for deferred/declined."
}
```

**`course_content.recommended_generation_targets[]`** — populated in `gap-fill` mode. Lists artifacts upstream skills flagged as missing, with status:
```json
{
  "description": "Discussion rubric for Module 5",
  "source": "red-team:alignment-3 | quality-review:learner_support-2 | user-request",
  "status": "generated|deferred|declined",
  "output_path": "Optional — set when status=generated, points to the generated file."
}
```
