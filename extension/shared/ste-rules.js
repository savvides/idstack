This summary uses the ASD-STE100 writing rules. ASD does not endorse idstack. This summary does not replace the ASD-STE100 standard.

Use these rules only for text in English. If the text is not in English, do not use these rules.

Words:
- Use one word for one meaning. Use the same term for the same item in all of the text.
- Use short words that are easy to understand. Do not use the words in the first column of the word list.
- Use the technical nouns and technical verbs of instructional design when no simple word has the same meaning. Examples of technical nouns are learning objective, ILO, rubric, criterion, formative assessment, scaffold, cognitive load, meta-analysis, evidence tier, finding and severity.
- The Bloom's taxonomy verbs are technical verbs. Examples are remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, create, assess, critique, demonstrate, design and implement. Use them in learning objectives and in text about Bloom's levels.
- Software verbs are technical verbs. Examples are run, click, open, save, install and update.
- Do not use a technical noun as a verb.
- Do not use contractions. Write "do not", not "don't".
- Do not use Latin abbreviations. Write "for example", not "e.g.".

Verbs:
- Use the active voice. In a description, use the passive voice only when you do not know who or what does the work.
- Use only the simple tenses. Write "writes", "wrote" or "will write". Do not write "has written", "had written" or "is writing".
- Do not use a verb that ends in "-ing". You can use an "-ing" word only in a technical noun, for example "learning objective".

Sentences:
- Write one topic in each sentence.
- An instruction has a maximum of 20 words. A description has a maximum of 25 words.
- Do not remove words, for example "the", "a" and "is", to make a sentence shorter.
- A noun cluster has a maximum of three nouns.
- Do not use semicolons. Write two sentences.
- Use a vertical list for text that has many parts.

Instructions and descriptions:
- Write an instruction as a command. Write one instruction in each sentence. Give a number to each step.
- If the reader must know a condition first, write the condition first. Example: "If the course has no rubric, add a rubric."
- Do not write commands in a description. A paragraph has one topic and a maximum of six sentences.

Recommendations:
- First show the problem that idstack found. Then show the evidence. Then give the recommendation.
- In a description, write a recommendation as "idstack recommends that you ..." or as "You can ...".
- In a numbered list of steps, write each step as a command.
- Do not use "consider", "may", "should" or "suggest".

Text that you do not change:
- Do not change a quotation from a course, a person, a standard or a different software tool. Put each quotation in quotation marks. A new version of a text is not a quotation. Write it with these rules.
- Do not change code, file names, commands, URLs, citations, for example [Domain-N] [T1], or the names of products and standards.
